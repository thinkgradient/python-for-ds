# Homework function wiki

This file contains a brief summary of the functions used in the homework notebook, as well as a link to the relevant documentation.

## Scikit-learn Functions:

- `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`: This function is used to standardise features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. It is commonly used before applying machine learning algorithms. [Link to documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html)

- `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`: This function is used to perform K-means clustering on a given dataset. It takes in parameters like the number of clusters, initialisation method, and random state. [Link to documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html)

- `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score`: This function is used to calculate the silhouette score for a set of samples and their corresponding cluster labels. It measures how well each sample fits in its assigned cluster and how well it is separated from other clusters. [Link to documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html)

- `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`: This function is used to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a given dataset. It reduces the dimensionality of the data by finding the directions in which the data varies the most. [Link to documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)

## Matplotlib Functions:

- `matplotlib.pyplot.scatter`: This function is used to create a scatter plot in Matplotlib. It takes in parameters like the x and y values, and can be customised with colors, markers, and other options.
