# Python for Data Science: Session 1

This is the directory for all the content relevant to the first session of the minicourse. In here you will find the installation guide, homework notebook and further reading. This week's homework will cover the majority of the basics including types, I/O, funciton definition and calling as well as looping and conditional statements - this will lead up to you creating a calculator, building on your learnings to do so!

If you're new with notebooks, please review the intro-to-notebooks file in the directory up for a breif overview and set-up.
