## Introduction to the capstone project

As the 'Python for Data Science' mini-course draws to a close, the time to test your new knowledge has arrived! Building upon all the previous homework notebooks, you are tasked with creating a k-means clustering model to classify the iris dataset. You will need to use the data analysis techniques that you put to the test last week to explore the dataset thoroughly with the aim of choosing the best features for creating your model with. Your solution should include meaningful plots and printed statistics that help justify your decision on which features to use. 

For those wishing to challenge themselves further, you may wish to explore using principle component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset - for more details on this, see the homework notebook as well as the `README.md` file for more details. The iris dataset doesn't have a large number of dimensions, unlike the dataset used in the example notebook from this week, but using PCA still may be of interest!

The notebook included for this week also gives a useful guide for training a k-means clustering model - please use this as your guide as well as the links in the further reading sections.

A few additional notes:

* K-means clustering is a very simple algorithm so the resutls achieved may weel be beaten by more sophisticated methods, don't be disheartened if the results you get aren't what you expected!
* K-means clustering is unsupervised, so we can't assess the results of the model be comparing the labels assigned. Bare this in mind as the iris dataset is labelled...
* When you have finished, please create a public GitHub repository containing your full solution including the code for the data analysis and visualisations - unfortunately I will not have the time to mark or review these, but your learning and development should be celebrated!
* Your solution can either be in the form of a `.py` or an interactive notebook.

Happy coding!
